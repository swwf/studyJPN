這個有沒有辦法幫我設計成手機好讀的頁面，這樣我可以打開手機後，直接使用來複習?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Understanding the Task**

I understand the user wants to convert the markdown file `歷程檔案/Vocabulary Preparation/N5/ 地點.md` into a mobile-friendly HTML page. I'll need to figure out the best approach to achieve this conversion.


**Planning the Conversion**

I've outlined a structure for the HTML page, including responsive design elements. Instead of tables, I'll use a card-based layout for each vocabulary word.  Each card will feature the Japanese word, reading, meaning, romaji, and memory hint.  The memory hint will be collapsible.  Next, I'll focus on the CSS for a clean, mobile-friendly design.


**Outlining the Structure**

My plan is forming. I've broken down the conversion into manageable steps: understanding the request, analyzing the markdown, proposing an HTML structure (card-based), designing the CSS, creating the files, and parsing the markdown.  I'll start with the file structure exploration, looking at `word_list_viewer.html` and `assets/style.css` for a better layout template.


**Reviewing Existing Code**

I'm now diving into `word_list_viewer.html` and `assets/style.css` to grasp the current layout approach and CSS standards. This will inform my design decisions for the mobile-friendly vocabulary viewer. I'm focusing on adapting the existing structure and design principles rather than building from scratch.


**Formulating HTML Structure**

I've decided to employ a card-based structure, where each vocabulary entry is presented as a distinct card with collapsible sections for romaji and memory hints. I'll read and parse the markdown content to extract the necessary information and build the HTML elements.  The HTML file will feature sections based on the "story stations" present in the markdown. The cards will include Japanese words, readings, and meanings, with optional details revealed on click/tap.


**Structuring the HTML**

I've outlined the HTML structure. I'll use a `<div>` with `class="container"` to manage the main content and `<h2>` elements to separate sections from the markdown. Each vocabulary entry will be a card with main information visible and romaji/memory hint hidden, toggling on click. Next step is CSS design.
